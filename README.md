## Problem Statement
Blackcreek's store pick-up points have seen increasingly heavy traffic. During rush hours, the long line of cars waiting to drive through disrupt traffic on the street, causing delays and disorder. This results in a stressful experience for everyone involved â€“ customers, store staff, and the neighborhood.
A solution had to be found to reduce waiting time by streamlining the pick-up process from car identification through order identification to delivery.

Furthermore, many problems i.e. delayed payments, high fees, frozen accounts surround most of centralized transaction platforms like PayPal. These online platforms have a single point of failure and also, the transaction data is mutable and not completely secure.
Thus, there is a requirement for decentralized storage of data to overcome most of these problems.

## Objectives
1. To setup an ALPR Camera to be able to detect Vehicle in real-time and recognize its License Plate ID so as to match it with the right Order ID.
2. To use Blockchain Technology to execute transactions and store relevant data in Blockchain storage.
3. To implement a Product Recommendation System in Application using User-Based Collaborative Filtering.
4. To implement a Basic Inventory system for adding / deleting items and keeping track of the stock left.
5. To implement Employee Management System which allows the Admin to be able to register employees, view/edit their data, and manage their tasks.
6. To implement Task Management System which distributes Tasks among Employees in an efficient manner so as to balance the workload.
7. To implement Employee Attendance Management System.
8. To generate Report Charts of the goods bought by customers over a period of time.
9. To implement Standard Security practices i.e. Access Policy, CSRF, XSS etc.
