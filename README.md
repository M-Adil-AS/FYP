## Problem Statement
Blackcreek's store pick-up points have seen increasingly heavy traffic. During rush hours, the long line of cars waiting to drive through disrupt traffic on the street, causing delays and disorder. This results in a stressful experience for everyone involved â€“ customers, store staff, and the neighborhood.
A solution had to be found to reduce waiting time by streamlining the pick-up process from car identification through order identification to delivery.
Furthermore, many problems i.e. delayed payments, high fees, frozen accounts surround most of centralized transaction platforms like PayPal. These online platforms have a single point of failure and also, the transaction data is mutable and not completely secure.
Thus, there is a requirement for decentralized storage of data to overcome most of these problems.
